# Cornell Notebook

## About
As someone who struggles taking notes, I wanted to create an app that will help
students in my same position. My solution is a note taking app that utilizes the note format created by Cornell University. The Cornell Notes format places emphasis on note-taker interaction by prioritizing key components of notes such as the essential questions, the notes themselves, as well as questions the notetaker may have while writing.
